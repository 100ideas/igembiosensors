Whether in your water, salad or steak, pathogenic E. coli causes upwards of 250,000 illnesses every year. To solve this problem, iGEM Calgary is developing the FerriTALE to detect harmful E. coli. It uses engineered proteins that detect and report the presence of dangerous E. coli in a sample.  The detector, TALE, binds to genomic markers specific to dangerous E. coli. Next, our TALEs are attached to the scaffold and reporter, Ferritin, that rapidly alerts the user to the presence of E. coli through a visible color change. We have integrated these proteins into a handheld device, similar to a home pregnancy test, that tells the user if dangerous E. coli is present. Moving forward, the FerriTALE can be tailored to detect other pathogens as the basis of a powerful new detection platform.",

This system couples the translation of the target gene to a fluorescent reporter gene; fluorescence will only be detected when the target gene is entirely translated. This construct enables synthetic biologists to quickly determine if a gene is being expressed without the need for costly antibodies or analytical instruments (e.g. mass spectrometry). Currently, we are utilizing this cassette to optimize the expression of limonene synthase, an enzyme that catalyzes the production of limonene, a monoterpene with potential as a renewable jet fuel.",

    "abstract": "Despite improvements in water quality, contaminants still interfere with farming in many of the world\u2019s biomes. For 2012 the Gaston Day School iGEM team\u2019s project is to help solve this problem by using the existing registry of parts to create new heavy metal detectors. We have shifted our project from last year\u2019s nitrate detector in order to focus on cadmium, arsenic, and lead contaminants in water. These metals are known to be used in insecticides, fungicides, and fertilizers and are also byproducts of industrial processes such as smelting. If ingested they can cause numerous health problems (more information can be found at the bottom of the page). To detect each metal, we constructed sensors by using multiple promoters to narrow the range of the heavy metals down to one or two contaminants. Then we combined it with GFP reporters to create the new part. GFP was used because our spectrophotometer can accurately measure it.\u00a0Once the parts were created, they were tested for accuracy and sensitivity. Many farmers need a way to measure the amount of heavy metals in water to determine whether the levels are dangerous; therefore, each heavy metal detector must be as sensitive as their respective federal limits in water. As the project continues, we plan to test the safety of the engineered bacteria and create survivorship curves as they are released into different environments, similar to last year\u2019s testing. When the final kit is constructed we plan to include the heavy metal detectors and all components necessary to run, accurately measure, and safely dispose of the tests. This kit will help agricultural and environmental fields make improvements in safety.",

So we designed a novel promoter harboring Ste12 and LexA binding sequences and placed it upstream of an ORF encoding a red fluorescent reporter fused to LexA binding and VP64 activator domains. Others have shown that this fusion protein induces its own expression from a LexA promoter. We propose that Ste12, activated in the pheromone response pathway, will bind the hybrid promoter and induce expression of the fusion protein, which will amplify and maintain its own expression. Therefore, when mating pheromone receptors on a haploid harboring this latch-type circuit are bound and activated, the cell will fluoresce and function as a rapid mating type detector.",

In quorum sensing based biosensors, detection of autoinducer activates transcription of a reporter gene, which must then be translated and accumulate to detectable levels, which can take two to four hours. In our system, we will use TraR, a protein used in the quorum sensing response of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which dimerizes only in the presence of its autoinducer. We have successfully fused traR to sequence for two separate complementary fragments of GFP. Upon addition of autoinducer, we predict that already accumulated TraR-GFP fragment monomers will dimerize, allowing the GFP fragments to interact and fluoresce.

However, there are numerous public health and environmental concerns regarding the oil sands extraction process. One environmental concern is the contamination of Canadian watersheds by seepage from tailings ponds. To better monitor this issue, we have engineered a novel biosensing platform with the electroactive bacterial species Shewanella oneidensis\u00a0MR-1, which has the unique capability to directly transfer electrons to solid-state electrodes. We exploit this feature by genetically manipulating\u00a0S. oneidensis\u00a0MR-1 to upregulate its metal-reduction capacity in the presence of analyte to generate direct current output in a whole-cell biosensor. Our goal is to develop a fully autonomous electrochemical biosensor that complements the current oil sands monitoring system by providing real-time data over extended periods of time. Furthermore, our device will circumvent the costs and complications of producing and maintaining photodiode circuits used for data acquisition in bioluminescent reporter systems by instead producing a direct electrical output. While our platform is adaptable to sensing a wide range of analytes, we will initially focus on arsenic-containing compounds and naphthalene,a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) \u2013 known contaminants of oil sands tailings ponds.

Induction of the arsenic-sensitive promoter occurs by the binding of arsenite to an inhibitory protein, de-repressing transcription. We have observed the arsenic responsive promoter from E. coli to have a consistent, low level of background induction. We have tested the hypothesis that by increasing the quantity of the inhibitory protein in the cell, we can quantifiably raise the threshold of the response.

    "abstract": "Our project aims to create a new system to quantify how environmental conditions effect the bacterium\u00a0E. coli\u00a0by engineering a system that produces a predictable response in a controlled environment. Many strains of\u00a0E. coli\u00a0possess flagella, a whip-like appendage that can be found protruding from both eukaryotic and prokaryotic single-celled organisms. The assembly and motor control of\u00a0E. coli\u00a0flagella is under the control of a key group of genetic factors primarily for flagella assembly and chemotactic control. Expression of these genes can be regulated by creating various combinations of genetic promoters, which modulate the activity of individual components of the flagella apparatus. By promoting the\u00a0E. coli\u00a0flagella genes under varying conditions, such as salt concentration, nitrate concentration, pH and temperature, we can identify a significant change in flagella rotation and frequency. Ultimately, this frequency can be translated into an audible range which can act as an indicator of the bacteria\u2019s distress based on the varied environmental condition (see below). Thus, by specifying the bacteria\u2019s response to an environmental change on a genetic level, the resulting frequency can be used as a convenient assay to determine the real time status of the culture.",

Last year, the BYU iGEM team genetically engineered E. coli to detect heat or ROS. This year we developed E. coli capable of simultaneously sensing lactate, heat and ROS, implemented a novel Cre-Lox system, and constructed a library of thermosensors. Our project uses two circuits, each with a unique reporter. The first circuit contains a RNA thermosensor driven by a ROS-inducible promoter, allowing expression of Cre recombinase when both heat and ROS are present. Although heat is transient, Cre ensures continued expression of the first reporter gene. The second circuit contains a periplasmic lactate sensor coupled to a second reporter. Finally, we have evolved a library of thermosensors that work in a narrow physiological range. Together, this two-circuit system may allow accurate and specific detection of early colon cancer cells.",

To detect our chosen inputs we are investigating the OxyR promoter and a thermo-sensitive riboswitch.

Both inputs activate a Cre/Lox system to remove a terminator sequence and allow transcription of a molecular signal.

We have found regulatory systems which respond to each of the biofuels of interest, and are using standard BioBricks assembly to create E. coli strains which can be used to perform fluorescence-based assays. By using fluorescent biosensors, we hope to lower costs (in both equipment and cost-per-sample) while maintaining a high degree of accuracy. In the interest of creating robust and accurate assays, we are also attempting to increase the magnitude and range of the linear fluorescence response through directed evolution. We hope to leverage multiple selections to both decrease basal fluorescence and increase the point where the response becomes saturated. As a more direct approach to increasing microbial biofuel yields, we also pursued the use of bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) as scaffolding for key enzymes in the ethanol producing and sensing processes. Through localizing crucial anabolic enzymes, as well as the beginning of our sensing cascades, to the BMC surfaces, we can increase fuel titers as well as our reliability in accurately sensing them.

Biosensors can be used in a wide range of applications - from the detection of toxic compounds in the environment up to clinical diagnostics. Because cells have to sense their surroundings, there are a lot of natural systems that can be used as biosensors. Unfortunately, cellular biosensors often have interfering properties that preclude any practical application. Common problems are the limited use outside the laboratory due to the use of genetically engineered cells, the low durability because of the usage of living cells and the appearance of undesired signals induced by endogenous metabolic pathways. To solve these problems, the iGEM-Team Bielefeld 2011 aims at developing a cell-free bisphenol A (BPA) biosensor based on a coupled enzyme reaction fused to S-layer proteins for everyday use. Bisphenol A is a harmful substance which is used in the production of polycarbonate. To detect BPA, it is degraded by a fusion protein under formation of NAD+ which is detected by an NAD+-dependent enzymatic reaction with a molecular beacon. Both enzymes are fused to S-layer proteins which build up well-defined nanosurfaces and are attached to the surface of beads. By providing these nanobiotechnological building blocks the system is expandable to other applications.",

The sensor is linked to a band-pass filter that leads to input-concentration-dependent GFP expression. Continuous increase of the input concentration and its detection, therefore, establishes a moving fluorescent band in the channel. Finally, if the input concentration exceeds a certain threshold, cells produce RFP and the device turns red. Due to its modularity, our SmoColi system can be used in fact as a quantifier for a range of substances, as long as the sensor is adapted.

The respective promoter is activated or deactivated by a specific metal-sensitive protein which binds to DNA dependent on the presence of that metal. As a consequence of this statistical event, there is a concentration-dependent transcription of the reporter gene, which is either GFP, luxAB or lacZ\u00b4. The second kind of metal sensors directly uses the characteristics of special proteins to obtain a measurement of the metal, e.g. by analyzing the activity of an enzyme that needs a special metal ion as a cofactor.

Other than using natural light-sensing proteins, engineered proteins have been designed from the natural templates. However, most of the light-sensing systems developed thus far focus on studying one light-sensing system at a time, characterizing the activation light spectra, active state, etc. Nobody has ever built systems capable of detecting multiple wavelengths until recently. In short, our project focuses on improving the existing multichromatic sensing systems by expanding the number of useful wavelengths. Our system can regulate the expression of three different genes independently from each other using three different wavelengths. These \"\"multichromatic coliroids\"\" upgrades the present coliroids, much like upgrading black-and-white movies to color TV.

With the renewed interest in nuclear energy in response to dwindling fossil fuel reserves, concerns over nuclear waste storage and disposal, and fear of radiological terrorism, the need for a cheap dosimeter is clear. A biological system that acts as a dosimeter would be a cheap and readily producible first response indicator that could be interpreted without training or calculation.\r\nThe Bio-Dosimeter\r\nIn order to monitor radiation dose the bio-dosimeter would need to sense incoming ionizing radiation, a trait that organisms do not normally possess. However, the genetic damage that makes radiation dangerous is also readily monitored by several highly specific systems in nature. One such example of this is the Lambda Bacteriophage, which switches from the dormant lysogenic state to the active lytic state in response to genetic damage in its bacterial host. Our project uses the lambda phage genome as a radiation biosensor as it has been extensively characterized and has tight control over gene expression.\r\nLambda Bacteriophage\r\nThe lambda bacteriophage controls switching between the lysogenic/lytic states once lysogeny has been estabilished through a bi-directional promoter (PR, PRM) with three binding sites with different affinities for repressor (Cl) and activator (Cro). The lysogen normally maintains lysogeny through a feedback loop with repressor Cl that simultaneously maintains Cl concentration within a set range and represses the Cro activator by activating the PRM promoter which expresses Cl and repressing the PR promoter which expresses Cro. However, in response to genetic damage the lambda phage exploits the host\u2019s SOS response to cleave the repressor. As Cl concentration declines, the stronger PR promoter begins to express Cro, which competes with Cl for binding sites and represses Cl\u2019s production.\r\nUsing the Bacteriophage as a Dosimeter\r\nBy taking the PR, PRM bidirectional promoter and placing desired response proteins such as GFP downstream of the activator Cro, the operator acts as a tightly regulated dosimeter with little chance of accidental false positives.",

Biosensors are useful molecules and/or cellular tools that allow detection of the presence of different metals including iron (II/III) and other compounds, even at detection levels beyond the limits of conventional methods (Colombian IGEM. IET Synthetic Biology Journal. 2007). Last year, the Colombian IGEM team developed a microbial biosensor device for iron detection under UV irradiation using synthetic biology. This year, in association with the Israeli team, we will develop a more sensitive biosensor device, in order to detect different levels of iron, including those below that of 0.5 ppm. The device will also be tested at different levels of oxygen and UV irradiation. Plasmid isolation, preparation of competent cells and cell transformation are being currently carried out in the laboratory at the Universidad Agraria in Bogota, Colombia. New parts designed by the Colombian group as well as parts from the MIT BioBrick will be assembled, in order to construct the genetic machine. This year, sequences from both upstream and downstream will be used for our project. One of the main new features of our device will be exposed to different environmental conditions such as oxygen levels, temperatures and varied light intensities.

Finally, when confronted with a new input, they are able to recognize whether it is the one that they were trained with or not. In other words, in this project we are educating the E.coli!\r\n\r\nOur system has the ability to behave in different ways according to an internal toggle inside it switching states based on the chemical substances that the system is exposed to. The toggle states could generally be used to trigger events such as enzyme synthesis, transcriptional regulation, virion production, or even cell death. Therefore, one may view the bacterial cell line containing this system as a multipurpose cell line. By adding a certain chemical to a cell line, the latter may be trained to exhibit a desired behavior, and then it is not necessary any more to construct two independent cell lines.\r\nThis means that one applies an \u201cinput engineering\u201d instead of a \u201cDNA engineering\u201d approach. If one extends this idea to several multi-inducible toggle switches being harbored in the same cell line, the number of possible phenotypes increases to 2n, where n equals the number of toggle switches. For example, if one would have 5 such toggle switches inside a cell line, 32 different behavior patterns would be possible.\r\nFor the purpose of creating a toggle switch that is activated in a specific phase only and not always (a multi-inducible toggle switch), as is required for stable biological automatons, we introduced the concept of double promoters to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, which can be helpful for engineering systems which exhibit a desired behavior only at specific times.",

IBD is a huge problem in developed countries, vastly growing with no effective therapy in sight. This disease is caused by an imbalance of immune T-cells, Th17 and T regulatory, which control inflammation and immunosuppression responses respectively. We propose a novel mechanism using synthetic biology that aims to regulate this balance in vivo. This involves a two-part device: one that regulates inflammation and the other immunosuppression. We cloned a device that recognizes superoxide producers, a byproduct of inflammation and Th17 proliferation, to produce retinoic acid, which blocks the further differentiation of Th17 cells. This device has been characterized, is well behaved and capable of recognizing superoxides, like paraquat, at optimum levels of 40 to 80 uM without growth inhibition. To control immunosuppression, we cloned and mutated the trp operon so that it recognizes 5-Methyl tryptophan, a target substrate of an enzyme involved in Treg immunosuppression, and designed a potential IL-6 excretion device to regulate Treg proliferation. The behavior of this novel tryptophan sensor has been studied by our group through the development of a mathematical model. Our results suggest that our construct has potential applications as a diagnostic or therapeutic tool for post-operative Crohn's patients.",

Even under the high temperature they are not easy to be inactivated. Moreover, they will maintain in the blood for weeks, much more than other kinds of antibiotics such as penicillin. The accumulation of aminoglycoside will also lead to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.\r\nBy studying the regulation of resistance, we have found the natural parts which are sensitive to the antibiotics. With the quantitative methods, we are measuring the response curve of them. Then the optimized devices will be constructed for aminoglycosides detection.\r\nMeanwhile, we are also studying on the molecular dynamics and mechanisms of regulation of resistance.

Nowadays, aflatoxin exposure is not only a serious problem for human health, but it could also become a serious threat in terms of food security issue of a country. ITB-Indonesia team for iGEM 2013 focuses on designing a whole cell biosensor for aflatoxin B1 detection in foods. The biosensor uses Escherichia coli as the chassis to build a genetic circuit using SOS response system to detect DNA damage caused by aflatoxin B1-oxide attack. The SOS response promoter is followed by a reporter gene coding a chromoprotein, therefore the concentration of aflatoxin B1 in food samples could be easily detected by the color change of the bacteria. For the ease of usage, we will design a syringe shaped device with our whole cell biosensor in it. This device would allow aflatoxin B1 to enter the device, but would not permit the cells to leave the device.",

In the last part, it is planned to clone the genes that will assist in expression of streptavidin on the surface of membrane of the model organisms. The model organisms for creating the biosensor are Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. E. coli will express the streptavidin through Lpp-Omp expression system, while S. cerevisiae will express this protein through Aga1 \u2013 Aga2 system.

The conjugation makes female gametes return to the state of un-differentiation(called G cells),which means they can divide again but are not sexually determined.Then,after several cell divisions,one G cell will differentiate into a G+ or G-,which, like zygote , can grow into next generation of the multicellular system maybe containing genes from both male and female gametes.\r\n\r\nWe also have another minor project aimed at detecting different concentrations of nitrate & nitrite in water,especially in drinking water.

Our aim, as the team \u201cBaskent_Meds\u201d, is developing bacteria which can recognize Legionella pneumophila specifically at species level by legionella quorum sensing, and respond by producing anti-Legionella peptide which is produced by some Staphylococcus strains. Quarum means \u201cminimum\u201d. Legionella pneumophila should sense the minimum amount of cells around to colonize in the environment and express its virulence. So our modified E. coli may sense the presence of Legionella pneumophila in any contaminated surface and kill it.",

We are developing a Coliophage Biosensor to detect E. coli in public waterways and lake water. Currently it takes three days to detect E.coli using the water testing method that is currently in place. A new method that has been developed by Stanek and Falkinham has improved this by detecting bacteriophage as a surrogate for E. coli. This method involves exposure of contaminated water to host bacterium expressing Bgal. Lysis of bacteria and release of the enzyme was correlated with extensive contamination. This procedure, however, takes three hours and involves filtration. We are designing a coliphage biosensor capable of detecting dangerous levels of E. coli within less than three hours without filtration.",

However, as all the heavy metals, even a small amount of Nickel higher than the essential dose could be toxic, leading to various noxious effects [1-2]: then the need to remove its excess from many substrates. Nowadays bacteria-mediated bioremediation from inorganic substances seems\tto be a considerably relevant frontier in microbic biotechnologies [3]. Our project aims to develop a living system, in an easy monitorable bacterial platform, who would work as a Nickel detector and a Nickel remediation system. The whole system is based on genetic parts from the pathogen Helicobacter pylori, whose evolution led to a stronger reliance on Nickel ions for host interaction and pathogenesis. Sensing relies on nickel regulator NikR from H. pylori (HpNikR): though homolog of E.coli NikR, it has a stronger dependance on Nickel ions and a wider range of regulated elements, being a rare case of pleiotropic regulator in bacteria. As HpNikR could contemporaneously activate and repress gene expression [4-5-6], we thought of developing a synthetic gene cluster under HpNikR - regulated promoters. With a double regulation, one of the promoters being activated while the other being repressed, the system allows to follow up Nickel sensing as a fluorescence signal from fluorescent proteins. Thus, adding bacteria to a nickel containing medium results in switching off a basal occuring green fluorescence and in switching on a red fluorescence signal.",

These hazardous organic compounds are extraordinary stable and not readily biodegradable. Thus they remain for many years in nature and belong to family of persistent pollutants. PCBs accumulate in animal fatty tissues due to their lipophilicity, starting from aquatic organisms and going further into the higher level of food chain. Indeed, they can be found in high concentrations in human adipose tissues. As most PCBs are probably carcinogenic (class 2A) and some are recognized endocrine disruptors, they lead to a series of important health issues. especially in France where a study revealed that higher levels of PCB in French people adipose tissues were observed than people from other parts of the world.\r\nAlthough PCBs are man-made and have no natural equivalents, some bacterial communities have evolved and developed the capacity to degrade PCBs. Degradation of highly chlorinated PCBs begins with an anaerobic reductive dechlorination that lowers the number of chlorine atoms carried by the PCB molecules. PCBs with few chlorine atoms can then be degraded via the biphenyl degradation pathway.\r\n\r\nOur project aims at constructing an Escherichia coli strain capable of degrading highly chlorinated PCBs. This will be achieved by introducing in an E. coli strains genes involved in the degradation of PCBs from the three most efficient PCB degrading strains described so far: Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, Burkholderia Xenovorans and Rhodoccocus jostii. Because the first degradation steps are anaerobic and later steps are aerobic, we want to introduce an oxygen based regulation of the expression of the different genes implicated in both aerobic and anaerobic degradation steps.

The biphenyl molecule is made up of two connected rings of six carbon atoms each, and a PCB is any molecule having multiple chlorines attached to the biphenyl nucleus. Two distinct classes of bacteria have now been identified that biodegrade PCBs by different mechanisms, including aerobic bacteria which live in oxygenated environments and anaerobic bacteria which live in oxygen free environments such as aquatic sediments. The aerobes attack PCBs oxidatively , breaking open the carbon ring and destroying the compounds. Anaerobes, on the other hand, leave the biphenyl rings intact while removing the chlorines. Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF) were introduced into the biosphere on a large scale as by-products from the manufacture of chlorinated phenols and the incineration of wastes. Due to their high toxicity they have been the subject of great public and scientific scrutiny. The evidence in the literature suggests that PCDD/F compounds are subject to biodegradation in the environment as part of the natural chlorine cycle. Lower chlorinated dioxins can be degraded by aerobic bacteria from the genera of Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas and Burkholderia.However, higher chlorinated dioxins requires anaerobic degradation process. Organic pollutants such as PCB and dioxins, produced in human beings activities in the last century, are toxic and carcinogenic which are able to promulgate widely and accumulate to a high level of concentration by food chain. Due to their inherent thermal and chemical stability, it is commonly considered as indestructible under normal incineration or burial. Nonetheless, by endowing some bacteria ability of utilizing such molecules as carbon source, cooperative evolution makes all possible! Enzymes assembled from related degradation pathways into our host strain serve as the function part. We introduce popular components involved in chemotaxis, quorum-sensing to regulatory parts, sense the environment signal, respond to move, accelerate growing and produce related degradation enzymes. After the cleaning work being finished, bacteria will return to the normal state. Taking the condition of our lab into account, we decide just deal with the aerobic degradation path way.

As the signal \"ticks\" the clock, the clock changes color and observer can use the color or combination of colors to tell what \"time\" it is.There are two types of clocks proposed by our team.The first type is a Binary Clock. In the Binary Clock, there are identical units (in fact not totally identical but almost) which are connected in series to make the entire clock. We call each unit a bit-unit. Each bit-unit can be turned on and off by its input signal and give its output as the input signal for the next bit in the series. So for example Bit1 can have 2 states ON or OFF, Bit1's output is the input for Bit2 to turn Bit2 ON and OFF. So with 2 bit-units, there are totally for states and these 4 states happen in a sequential order 00 -> 01 -> 02 -> 03, because Bit2's input is Bit1's output. If we extend to 3 bit-units, the number of possible states will grow exponentially to 8.Each bit-unit is said to be modular because, apart from input receptor and output molecule, the internal machinery are identical.We also proposed a Linear Clock. The linear model is similar to and simpler than the Binary model. The difference is that each bit-unit is turned ON only once and once it is turned OFF by the next bit-unit, it will stay OFF forever. So you can imagine this system as a string of light globes, the light jumps from one globe to the next and people can read the time by just looking at which globe is on. This model is also highly modular and the internal machinery is considerably less complex than the binary system.The ultimate goal of these systems is to construct a biological production pipeline of which the systems can keep track on what stage it is and decide what reagents to release for the next step.\r\n",

Connectibility refers to the ability to connect the output of one device to the input of another device, while extensibility refers to the dual abilities to rationally design new devices and to combine multiple devices in one organism. Our project uses terminator/attenuator (T/A) hairpin sequences (gates) to control transcription and anti-sense RNA as input/output signals to/from the devices. We call this approach Terminator/Attenuator anti-sense Logic (T/AasL \u2013 pronounced \u201ctossle\u201d). It solves the connectibility problems of common protein-based approaches because the anti-sense output of one device is used to disrupt formation of T/A hairpin structures of downstream devices, thus activating them. In addition, because RNA secondary structures can be rationally designed (using our m-fold derived analysis program) we can readily construct a large family of devices with minimal cross-talk for inclusion in a single cell.\r\n",

    "abstract": "The aim of our project is to create a biosensor that will detect BPA and other estrogen-like compounds in the environment. BPA is a toxin that has been shown to leech from certain types of plastic that are used in everyday life. Animal studies have shown that BPA is linked to various forms of cancer and other detrimental effects, which are likely to affect humans as well. Having a biosensor that can detect soil and water contaminated with BPA would be a useful tool indeed. Our project relies on the mechanism by which BPA affects cells. As an estrogen-like compound, BPA has the ability to mimic estrogen. When taken into the cell, it can bind to the cytoplasmic estrogen receptors, and activate genes related to estrogen, tricking cells into thinking they are in an environment containing estrogen when they are not. By introducing the estrogen receptor into \"E. coli\", we can use it to activate transcription of reporter genes to allow for easy visual identification of environments contaminated with BPA. Furthermore, the system can be used to activate recently characterized genes for BPA metabolism (BisdA, BisdB) in order to help with bioremediation of contaminated areas. While proving the principle in an \"E. coli\" system is our main goal for this year\u2019s project, we are thinking ahead to future development of other applications. For example, a BPA detector system put into a plant could serve as convenient 'BPA-sentinel plant' and early warning system if planted in areas at risk for contamination. Project 2 is focused on developing the tools that would allow us to move our project into plants. These will comply with the standard iGEM parts requirements and will allow anyone to use any standard biobricks in plants, opening iGEM up to the plant realm. Also, we plan on developing a \"cell free\" version of our system that would allow for cheap and quick detection of BPA \"in vitro\". This could prove to be of much benefit to poorer or third world nations, which may not be able to afford the resources necessary to maintain the plant system, or where poor regulations regarding BPA have lead to a very high risk of environmental contamination.\r\n",

    "abstract": "The tailing ponds created when water is used to extract oil from the Alberta tar sands or other mining operations pose a major environmental dilemma. How can we isolate the tailings and byproducts of the extraction process? Despite the efforts of the corporations responsible, chemicals can leech from the ponds into the surrounding ground water and soil. These toxic and often corrosive water beds not only affect the immediate land and water environment but also cause severe repercussions to larger ecosystems as much of the wildlife relies on getting their food and water from the now disrupted bionetwork. The exact composition of tailing ponds is highly complex, often laced with heavy metals and other toxic chemicals, such as aromatic hydrocarbons, and are difficult and expensive to filter or degrade. One powerful example is the high level of mercury in our fresh water fish, stemming from the tailing ponds of gold mining operations and the refinement of chloralkali metals. It is our goal to create a bacterial vacuum cleaner, or \u201cBacuum\u201d, which will seek out and degrade a particular harmful hydrocarbon. We intend to use the theophylline riboswitch we worked on last year as a platform for directed evolution to create a novel riboswitch capable of binding a particular aromatic hydrocarbon or class of hydrocarbons. The riboswitch will be used to control expression of the motility protein cheZ in Escherichia coli at low concentrations, thus directing the bacterium towards local areas of high ligand concentration. At a threshold level, a second riboswitch will be used to activate a pathway capable of metabolizing the aromatic hydrocarbons. Ultimately, the resulting product will be funneled into an anabolic pathway, such as the TCA cycle or fatty acid biosynthesis, from which an alternative fuel source can be produced, thereby turning toxic tailings ponds into a bioreactor with the help of a self-guiding \"search and destroy\" bacterial operative.\r\n",

These \"pulses\" are generated by the action of an inducer molecule that triggers the synthesis of a protein of interest and simultaneously induces a repressor protein to terminate expression as well as an enzyme to degrade the inducer signal, thereby returning the system to its initial state. By co-culturing populations of inducer-synthesizing cells and pulse-generating receiver cells, we hope to achieve self-sustaining oscillatory gene expression dynamics that could render long term culture-based recombinant protein synthesis more sustainable.

Some structures have been shown to naturally self-assemble under speci\ufb01c conditions [1], but this is limited to a very small subset of all those possible. Other techniques, such as the use of optical tweezers [2], although promising, are human-intensive, a possible disadvantage in certain applications where structures need to change dynamically in response to certain conditions. With this in mind the BCCS iGEM 2008 project aims at developing miniature \u201cBacto-Builders\u201d to help. All construction projects require the manipulation of varying size components, many much greater than any individual. To make this possible, teams of individuals work together with a common outcome in mind. In aim of transferring this behaviour to our \u201cBacto-Builders\u201d, we will investigate the possibility of utilising large numbers of E. coli to perform a task too great for any individual cell. Speci\ufb01cally, this will involve the physical movement of particles through direct contact with a swarm of bacteria working together in a co-ordinated manner. The ultimate goal is to make collective behaviour emerge by bacteria adhering to a set of simple rules so that particles are assembled according to some desired pattern. Furthermore, patterns or structures could be evolved in real time with bacteria adapting to new dynamic requirements or autonomously forming new ones. To create these structures, each bacterium searches randomly through an environment to \ufb01nd a suitable particle. On contact, it attempts to push the particle towards a goal (chemoattractant gradient). It also sends out a short range quorum signal to tell nearby bacteria, in a position to help with particle movement, that a particle is in the vicinity and therefore to move towards the goal chemoattractant. By altering the pattern of the chemoattractant gradient, it will be possible to place particles in a speci\ufb01c con\ufb01guration. For the longer term, we envisage different sets of bacteria performing complementary tasks. For example, one group, the \u2019architects\u2019, may have the job of \ufb01nding the locations that particles need to be placed. Once found, they emit a chemoattractant signal that the second group, the \u2019workmen\u2019 (which could be engineered in order to exert more force than normal), can use to move the particles to the necessary location. This could then be extended to allow bacteria to set locations that change over time leading to structures that evolve either due to a de\ufb01ned genetic program, or environmental cues, whereby bacteria would assimilate necessary environmental information, and then decide on the best course of action.\r\n",

    "abstract": "The specific goal of our project was to design a bacterial reprogrammable memory, i.e. colonies of genetically engineered E. coli immobilized in solid medium where they work as an array of binary memory cells. To engineer the bacteria we designed a modular genetic Flip-Flop composed of two parts (Figure 1): a binary memory block and an induction block, sensitive to UVc radiation. UVc has been chosen to have a fine spatial selectivity in programming the memory cells, whereas IPTG should be used to reset the entire memory. The molecular circuit can switch between two different stable states (LacI-ON and TetR-ON), driven by the external stimuli UVc and IPTG. LacI-ON represents the stable state in which LacI gene is active and LacI protein represses the TetR gene expression, with a positive feedback. Therefore, the LacI-ON state coincides with the TetR-OFF condition. On the contrary, the TetR-ON represents the state with the TetR gene active and the LacI gene silenced (LacI-OFF). Owing to the coexistence of two stable states (bistability), this circuit is capable of serving as a binary memory. We denominated it genetic Flip-Flop since it works as a SR Latch: LacI state is the q output and TetR state is the output. Uvc is the set signal and IPTG is the reset signal. Indeed, IPTG stimulation inhibits LacI repressor, thus can cause the transition from the LacI-ON state to the TetR-ON. UVc radiation, inactivating LexA repressor through the SOS response [Friedberg et al. 1995] can cause the opposite transition from LacI-ON to TetR-ON. The core elements of this epigenetic memory are the two mutually regulated promoters (see Figure 1), each designed as a constitutive promoter flanking an indipendent operator site. In this way, the promoter transcriptional strength and the repressor binding affinity can be independently fixed. Mathematical model analysis and computer simulations were used to obtain a rational design of the regulated promoters. By the model we found the analytic relationships to quote the regulated promoter in terms of transcriptional strength and sensitivity to the repressor and we established such a relevant circuit properties as the bistability and the dynamical response to inputs.\r\n",

To tap possibilities of transmembrane programming, the Freiburg 2008 iGEM team provides an extensible system comprising an external framework with spatial resolution, a concept for modifying natural receptors, and a modular set of fusion-Biobricks for the construction of synthetic receptors. Spatial resolution in the nanometer scale is provided by DNA-Origami modified with distinct patterns and combinations of ligands. Receptors are decoupled from their natural ligands by fusion with artificial binding domains. The Biobrick collection contains signal sequences, binding domains, transmembrane domains, and effector domains featuring split enzymes and split fluorescent proteins for immediate readout.\r\n",

    "abstract": "Ecolicence to kill: Engineering E.coli for targeting pathogenic microorganisms Pathogenic microorganisms represent a major challenge to both medicine and industry. Microbial communities known as biofilms prove to be particularly resistant to conventional therapies [1] and demonstrate the need for alternative methods to fight bacterial growth. The formation of biofilms, as well as other processes such as virulence, antibiotic production, and sporulation, are regulated by communication circuits that depend on small signalling molecules called autoinducers. Our aim is to exploit this communication mechanism by engineering synthetic bacteria that are able to target potentially harmful autoinducer-secreting species and kill them. Working with E. coli as a model system, we plan to engineer separate \u201ckiller\u201d and \u201cprey\u201d cells, and divide our project into two complementary modules. The \u201csensing module\u201d comprises the modification of E. coli\u2019s chemotaxis [2] system to make killer cells move towards prey cells. This requires the engineering of a \u201csensing module\u201d which propagates a prey-specific stimulus to the downstream signalling cascades, prompting the cells to swim towards the gradient of such a stimulus. The directed swimming stops only in the region where the stimulus is maximal, i.e. in the vicinity of the prey. The \u201ckilling module\u201d ensures that once in the vicinity of the prey, a bacteriocidal mechanism is activated. Computer models will show how both modules behave in concert and probe the efficiency of the system in defined spatial environments. Future directions, which are beyond the scope of this project, include the modification of the sensory and killing modules, adjusting the range of targets to real pathogens, but also other organisms, specific cell types or even cancer cells.\r\n",

    "abstract": "Light controlled heavy metal carrying E. coli machine Heavy metals are natural components of the Earth's crust. They cannot be degraded or destroyed. To a small extent they enter our bodies via food, drinking water and air. As trace elements, some heavy metals (e.g. copper, selenium, zinc) are essential to maintain the metabolism of the human body. However, at higher concentrations they can lead to poisoning. Heavy metal poisoning could result, for instance, from drinking-water contamination (e.g. lead pipes), high ambient air concentrations near emission sources, or intake via the food chain. We designed a E.coli machine to control heavy metal concentration in water by using phototaxis induced tunable carrying system on E.coli membrane. In our system, there are two light sources. One of them is for the metal source and another is for the destination to where we want to carry metal atoms. And our machines have phototaxis ability. In addition to this, they have metal binding domain in outer surface and bacteriorhodopsin. When we open light at the metal source, they start to move toward source and catch the metal atoms. Then we open the light at the destination while closing the light at the source. So our machines move toward the destination. After the arrival our machines will be exposed to light with specific wavelength to activate bacteriorhodopsin leading to small local pH changing at the outer surface. This pH changing causes the release of metal atoms from the metal binding domain. Eventually, system starts from the beginning and so on. As a result we will make E.coli cells act as trucks that carry metal ions on our medium from the metal uptake location to the release locations and also the path are illumintated by lights at specific wavelenghts.\r\n",

We wanted this to be cheaply and readily available for deployment in areas where access to medical resources, such as refrigeration and sophisticated laboratories, is limited or absent. We chose to use Bacillus subtilis as a method of delivery due to its ability to sporulate. The sensor bacteria could then be dried down as spores, which are very stable and extremely resilient to hostile environmental conditions, and rehydrated when required. The ambient temperature of much of the developing world is ideal for the growth of Bacillus spp. without the use of incubation equipment. Gram-positive bacteria communicate using quorum communication peptides. Research has shown that these peptides are extremely strain-specific. We chose to engineer B. subtilis 168 to detect four Gram-positive pathogens by their quorum communication peptides. The different combinations of quorum communication peptides would be sensed by the engineered bacterium, and this signal converted into a visual output as fluorescent proteins such as mCherry, GFP, CFP and YFP. Mapping multiple inputs to three output states is a multiplexing problem. The design of the genetic circuitry to do this is non-trivial and is not feasible manually. We therefore chose to use a biological implementation of an artificial neural network (ANN). Our team members wrote, designed and implemented a complete suite of tools that allowed the design and simulation of regulatory networks. We aimed to use this software to design an appropriate gene regulatory network that behaved as an ANN. An essential part of the approach was the use of computational evolution to design circuits with predictable behaviour even when the details of the required topology are unknown in advance. Models were encoded in the modelling language CellML because of its ability to model individual virtual parts that can be easily assembled, in a bottom up fashion, into a circuit which can be simulated. We aimed to translate this model into a sequence that could be implemented as BioBricks.\r\n",

Inspired by the flagellar motor machine, our clock at this stage of developpement serves as a chassis to be used in building future modular molecular machines in an optimized and coordinated manner. It may serve as well to control in an optimized fashion multi-reaction pathways. To achieve this incredible project, we relied on a well characterized genetic structure that allows a specific sequence of fluorescent proteins expression to occur in a First In - First Out order. This FIFO behavior enables us to define a rich color encoding of day time. An additional negative feedback loop generates clock oscillations! Based on in-depth studies and experimentally measured parameters we developed predictive models that suggest that this core system is not likely to demonstrate stable oscillations due to damping phenomenon leading to a stationary steady-state. Importantly, our modeling approach provided us with alternative improved designs that should lead in principle to an optimized BacteriO'Clock. In particular, this is achieved through synchronization at the population level by adopting a quorum sensing feedback mediated by HSL production that enforces a necessary delay and provides an elegant cellular synchronization mechanism :\r\n",

This infection can be treated with multi-drug regime, but this is often associated with induced antibiotic resistance and does not protect individuals from re-infections. Vaccination against H. pylori can therefore be a viable alternative to control this widespread infection. However, developing an effective vaccine against H. pylori has presented a challenge because H. pylori or its components, which have frequently been used as parts of vaccines, are modified by bacteria such that they evade host defense mechanisms. Using synthetic biology approaches we managed to assemble functional \u201cimmunobricks\u201d into a designer vaccine with a goal to activate both innate and acquired immune response to H. pylori. We successfully developed two forms of such designer vaccines. One was based on modifying H. pylori component (flagellin) such that it can now be recognized by the immune system. The other relied upon linking H. pylori components to certain molecules of the innate immune response (so called Toll-like receptors) to activate and guide H. pylori proteins to relevant compartments within the immune cell causing optimal innate and acquired immune response. Both types of vaccines have been thoroughly characterized in vitro (in test tubes or cells) as well as in vivo (laboratory mice) exhibiting substantial antibody response. Our strategy of both vaccines\u2019 design is not limited to H. pylori and can be applied to other pathogens. Additionally, our vaccines can be delivered using simple and inexpensive vaccination routes, which could be suitable also in third world countries.\r\n",

By doing this we expect to gain insight into a fundamental aspect of ecological dynamics which is currently not well understood. On the other hand, we expect to show that measuring changes in resistivity is an effective way to determine the activity of the efflux pump, and that this can become an efficient indicator of real time transcription for in vivo experiments. To achieve this, we designed a system where rcnA is under the regulation of the lambda repressor CI which itself is under the regulation of Vibrio fisheri\u2019s quorum sensing core components: LuxR and AHL. The former is constitutively produced and the latter is our input signal. Further regulation of the system is achieved by constitutively synthesizing AiiA, which degrades AHL, and by RcnR, RcnA's natural repressor which is inactivated in the presence of nickel. All the protein components of the system are encoded in two devices: the first one contains the efflux pump, and the second one the regulatory cascade. The reason for this partitioning is that in this way RcnA can be integrated with any desired regulatory upstream signal. Once the system is built and implemented on E. coli, we will measure the medium's resistivity on a real time basis through a set of copper electrodes connected to a multimeter. The monitoring device will be connected to a computer which will filter the noise in the signal and return a sound depending on the resistivity\r\n",

To address these problems, we have built several genetic circuits that work sequentially to repair the heart. First, we have built an inducible differentiation circuit that closely resembles the endogenous differentiation pathway, to program cells to become cardiomyocytes. Second, we have built circuits that use the extracellular domains of chimeric proteins to target cells to damaged cardiac tissue. Upon binding, novel receptor-coupled intein-mediated signaling domains activate effector genes that then aid in integration, inhibition of cell death, and the alteration of the tissue microenvironment. We have shown that both the targeting and signal transduction circuits work in cell culture models of MI.\r\n",

Baker\u2019s yeast, S. cerevisiae, has \r\nbecome an invaluable eukaryotic model for molecular biology research for\r\nmany reasons. One, it utilizes many proteins and biological pathways \r\nhomologous to those in humans. Consequently, investigating these \r\nmolecules and systems in yeast has provided unparalleled insight into \r\nthe genetics of humans. Two, because yeast is unicellular and therefore\r\ngrows fast, it can be studied more readily than many other organisms, \r\nespecially higher eukaryotes. Another useful characteristic of yeast is\r\nits ability to exist in populations of different ploidy, either diploid\r\nor haploid. The process in which ploidy arises is governed by the yeast\r\nmating pathway, which is well studied.\r\nA haploid yeast cell is either mating type \u2018a\u2019 (MATa) or mating \r\ntype \u2018\u03b1\u2019 (MAT\u03b1). In the elucidation of biochemical and genetic processes\r\nin yeast, many times it is necessary to initiate sporulation of diploid\r\nyeast cells. After sporulation occurs, there are four haploid cells; \r\ntwo MATa and two MAT \u03b1. To continue analysis, differentiating between \r\nthe haploid cells is often crucial, and the necessary assay to do this \r\ncan take 2 to 3 days. We propose to cut this time to a matter of seconds\r\nby constructing a plasmid with fluorescent markers that preferentially \r\nactivate depending on the mating type. If the cell is MATa, one \r\nfluorescent protein is produced. If the cell is MAT\u03b1, another \r\nfluorescent protein is produced. Simply shining a UV lamp over the cells\r\nwill reveal the mating type, allowing for the cells to be easily \r\nseparated.\"\r\n",

Whether it is in industrial, biological, or chemical applications, controllers provide a way to keep systems functioning properly. A vital part of any control system is the comparator. This component compares a set point value and a measured value, and determines which is larger. It then sends the appropriate signal to the controller, which reacts to bring the system back to the set point. In typical applications, the controller equipment is electronic. However, our team set out to create a comparator using only genetic components. This comparator could potentially be used as part of a new, solely biological control system that could be used to treat many diseases afflicting humans, for example diabetes. This comparator could compare the blood sugar of a patient to what it should be, and send this result to a control system that could compensate, for example by changing the levels of insulin. In order to undertake this task, a system involving six genes was designed. For our system, the two inputs (one representing the set point and one representing the measured value) are IPTG and aTc. These inputs will activate the transcription of the LacI and TetR proteins, and set in motion the rest of the system to produce the outputs. Depending on the amounts of the two inducer molecules added to the system, either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or red fluorescent protein(RFP) will be produced. The actual design of the system can be seen below. In order to complete this project, a total of six genes will have to be cloned into plasmids, and two new BioBrick parts will be produced. One will be a TetR and p22-MNT dual-repressed promoter, and the other will be a LacI and lambdaphage cI dual-repressed promoter. We will also build mathematical models and conduct computer simulations that will help with the designs. This project will pave the way for other parts of a true genetic PID controller to be produced, which could be an exciting scientific development in the near future.\r\n",

If both carbon sources are present, however, P. pastoris prefers to utilize ethanol first. This preference is controlled by the AOXI promoter. Fusing the AOXI promoter with a fluorescent protein gene will allow visible detection of the expression of AOXI. In supplying the yeast with ethanol and methanol simultaneously, the cells should produce the fluorescent protein after ethanol consumption; resulting in a visible color and fluorescence. The concentration of ethanol can be determined by measuring the time before fluorescence and in doing so, will make plausible the development of a breathalyzer device and additional sensor systems.\r\n",

Gardner et al. showed in 2003 the construction of a toggle switch using gene-regulatory circuits. Our project is to design a similar toggle switch with neurons. Highly differentiated neurons can be made to produce and/or respond to specific neurotransmitters; and have receptors for these neurotransmitters also. The genetic regulation determines what kinds of neurons embryonic stem cells differentiate into. The toggle switch is constructed as follows: a cluster of pacemaker neurons constantly excites two clusters of neurons that are designed to cross-repress each other. With an external inhibitory input, either of these neural clusters can be repressed, immediately following which it ceases to repress the other cluster of neurons. This in turn represses the first cluster of neurons, which remains repressed even if the external repression is taken away. Thus, it can be held in a steady state.\r\n",

To achieve control over our system, bacteria transfer DNA via conjugation only if certain conditions are met. In our design, E. coli transfers the genes to metabolize lactose in S. cerevisiae, but only where lactose is prevalent, glucose is minimal, and yeast proximity is sensed via a yeast-produced signaling molecule. It therefore provides a means for conditional, not constitutive, gene transfer between diverse organisms.

    "abstract": "The Utah State University iGEM team project is focused on creating an efficient system for producing and monitoring PHA production in microorganisms. One goal of our research is to develop and optimize a method, using fluorescent proteins, for the detection of maximum product yield of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB, a bioplastic) in recombinant E. coli and in C. necator. In order to develop an optimal PHB detection system, we worked to identify the most efficient reporter genes, and the best promoter sequences that would allow the GFP reporter to indicate maximum PHB production.\r\n",
